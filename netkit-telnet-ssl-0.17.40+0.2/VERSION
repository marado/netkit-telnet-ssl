Version 0.13 16-Sep-1997 tjh (tjh@cryptsoft.com)
	- CRLF on messages in sslapp.c
	- fixed built-in service name to port number code for sites that
	  don't have SSL things in their services list (https, telnets, etc)
	- work around gcc 2.7.2 solaris 2.5.1 compiler bug in telnet/commands.c

Version 0.12 02-Aug-1997 tjh (tjh@cryptsoft.com)
	- fixed up check for secure mode when running with ssl_only 
	  set - thanks to Simon Gerraty (sjg@zen.quick.com.au) for 
	  pointing this combination out.

Version 0.11 01-Jun-1997 tjh (tjh@cryptsoft.com)
	- SSLeay-0.8.0 port
	- reorganised the code so that most of the SSLeay stuff is
	  now in lib/libtelnet/sslapp.c and is shared between the
	  client and the server so things are easier to maintain

Version 0.10 06-Aug-1996 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
	- updated the messages from telnet on startup so that the
	  user is 100% sure of when SSL is being used and when it 
	  is not being used (thanks to Eric for hassling me to do this)
        - extra options for working with SSLeay-0.6.x which changed
	  a lot of the verify handling stuff with support for 
	  client certificate exchange ... still to be documented
	  in detail
	    telnetd -z certrequired -z secure -z verify=1 -z certsok
	    telnet  -z secure -z cert=FILENAME.pem -z key=FILENAME.pem
	- added in support for all the telnetd args being comma separated
	  so that braindead inetd's (SunOS 5.3) can have lots of options
	  in the one option to work around arg count limits! You can
	  now do this
	    telnet -z certrequired,secure,debug,certsok

	- there is now documentation for SSL telnet ... and it should
	  be read especially if you are going to use certificates for
	  authentication

Version 0.9 01-Jul-1996 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - hmm ... merged in some additional things ... and I don't
	  recollect exactly what :-)

Version 0.8 01-Jan-1996 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - fixed up gettimeofday to add the extra parameter that
  	  is required under SunOS 5.4+ (by default) ... thanks to 
	   J.J.Bailey <jjb@bcc.com>
	- get the checking for -z secure correct - thanks to 
	  James Walter Martin III <jwm3@harriet.jwm3.org> for pointing out
          that I had it wrong initially
	- fixed major security flaw in lib/libtelnet/ssl.c thanks to 
	  Christop Martin for pointing this one out!


Version 0.7 21-Dec-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - SSLeay 0.5.0b support
	=> note: now using telnetd.pem for public+private key
	(telnetd/ext.h now displays the SSLtelnetd version)

Version 0.6 03-Nov-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)

Version 0.5 18-Sep-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - fixed up SSL_accept, SSL_connect as Eric changed the return 
        codes on me without letting me know (again)!
	- fixed up inet_addr.c for SunOS 4.1.3 as per email from
	Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>
	- yet another linux patch - this time to fix termio includes
	thanks to Warwick Heath <warwick@rcc-irc.si>
	- include the security patch (modified) for removing unwanted
	things from the environment of telnetd (things that effect
	shared libraries) as per the CERT announcement. Note that
	this patch doesn't log a hack attempt explicitly - perhaps
	it should. (01-Nov-95) 
	
Version 0.4 18-Jul-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au) 
        - updated to the new error handling stuff in SSLeay-0.4.4
	and added -cipher=cipherlist and printout of subject
	and issuer of the certificate offered by the server.

Version 0.3 09-Jul-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - 01-Jul-95 tjh - merged patches from Steven Schoch 
	<schoch@sheba.arc.nasa.gov> that add in the option of having
	a file that allows you to not have to enter a password if you
	have a matching certificate (and the server is running with
	the new -z certsok option and the user is in /etc/ssl.users)
	[look in lib/libtelnet/ssl.c for more details until I document
	this a little better]
        - 30-Jun-95 tjh - applied the CERT advisory security patch that
	I happened to have missed before to bring the code up to date
	with the "current" BSD telnetd auth stuff
        -  set utmp entry to be tn0xff0xff so that comsat doesn't find
	the entry twice - really need to know what the *real* id should
	be set to. (SunOS 5.x) ... and this is still not *right*
        -  fixed up building under SunOS 4.1.3 
	thanks to Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>
	- telnet client now builds cleanly on 
	SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x, IRIX 5.x, HPUX 9.x, DGUX 5.x, Linux
        - telnetd fixes for Linux from bogk@inf.fu-berlin.de (Andreas Bogk) 
        to work around an ncurses "feature" ... see terminaltypeok()
	which was also emailed in by aeppert@dialin.ind.net a few weeks 
	later
	- telnetd has now been tested on
	SunOS 5.x, IRIX 5.x, Linux

Version 0.2 09-Jun-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - fixed up the handling of utmpx so that we can use the "normal"
	/bin/login program rather than our separate login program which
	fixed the SunOS 5.3 problem
	No utmpx entry. You must exec "login" from the lowest level "shell".
	- thanks to bogk@inf.fu-berlin.de (Andreas Bogk) for pointing
	out that I hadn't cleaned up that part of the SRA base I've 
	built on top of.
	- HPUX builds now ... still need to put in the pty handling code
	if I want telnetd to work I think

Version 0.1 06-Jun-1995 tjh (tjh@mincom.oz.au)
        - first "released" version. Code is really still pre-alpha as
	it was implemented last night so at the moment use it at your
	own risk. :-)
